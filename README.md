<h1>ACNH Critterpedia</h1>

<h2><a href="https://acnh-critterpedia.gh0start.com/">Live</a></h2>

This React application was created as a personal project, used to display information about the various 
critters that can be caught in the game Animal Crossin New Horizons. 

On the initial load of the page, the default lists of all critters are displayed, separated into Insects, 
Fish, and Sea Creatures. These lists can be filtered to display only critters that appear in specified months, 
controlled by the two dropdown menues below the header. The hemisphere dropdown has a default value of Northern
Hemisphere.

When lists have been filtered to a speficied month, critters will display different background colors to indicate
critters that are either newly available, or soon to be unavailable in the specified month.

When a critter from any list is clicked, further details are displayed below, including a larger and more realistic image,
a table that shows all months in which the critter appears, and a graphic that displays what times the critter can appear.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
